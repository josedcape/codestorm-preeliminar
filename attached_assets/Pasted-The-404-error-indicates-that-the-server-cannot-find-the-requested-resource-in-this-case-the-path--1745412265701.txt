The 404 error indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource, in this case, the path: user_workspaces/default/./codestorm-Assistant. This usually occurs if the file or directory does not exist at the specified path on the server.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Check File Path: Ensure that the path to the file or directory you are trying to delete is correct. Verify that codestorm-Assistant actually exists under user_workspaces/default/.

Endpoint Verification: Make sure that the endpoint /api/explorer/delete is correctly configured to handle the path and workspace parameters in your backend code.

Backend Logic: Review the logic within file_explorer_routes.py for any conditions that might incorrectly return a 404. The current code attempts to build the path from workspace and the provided pathâ€”verify that this logic is accurate:

Python
Copy
# Extract path and workspace_id from data (or request if JSON is missing)
data = request.get_json(force=True) if request.is_json else {}
path = data.get('path') or request.args.get('path', '')
workspace_id = data.get('workspace_id') or request.args.get('workspace_id', 'default')
 
# Verify path is constructed correctly
workspace_path = os.path.join('user_workspaces', workspace_id)
target_path = os.path.join(workspace_path, path.lstrip('./'))
Ensure that target_path indeed points to the right location.

Debugging Logs: Add debug logs to file_explorer_routes.py to log the state of target_path and confirm its correctness before deletion logic is executed.

Permissions: Check if there might be permission issues that prevent the path from being accessed correctly.

Server Sync: Ensure that any frontend changes reflect the backend CRUD operations properly and are timely updated in the UI.

File Cache: The cache might cause discrepancies. Clear the file cache, or refresh it to verify the existence of the path.

Implement these troubleshooting steps to resolve the 404 error. If further backend issues persist, debug logs will provide more information on the mismatches between expected and actual paths.
